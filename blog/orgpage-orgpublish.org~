#+Title: Org Page or Org Publish?
If you had come to this page in the first few days of March you would have found it created with org-page, and a first blog post on using org-page.

Now you find it with org-publish. Why the change?

First, org-page seems to be a fine tool and produces a very satisfactory result. The reason to choose one over the other seems to me to be less about whether one is /better/ than the other, and more about what it is you want to do. If you are looking for an out-of-the-box solution for using emacs and org-mode to write blog posts, and you want to utilize github.io to host your pages, *and* you don't really care about how it is done, you just want it to work; then use org-pages. You will have some headaches getting started still. The documentation is spotty, but there are some brave souls who have ventured before you, and they give enough details to get you started. I will link to them below. The most important factor contributing to your success will be to fully internalize the model behind org-pages. It is based in the idea of two git branches, one that tracks your source and one that tracks the displayed html. This is a different use of branches than a typical project. But once that is settled, and as long as your use case is a simple blogging set up you should be quickly up and running. I will also add that I had a question about org-pages and the maintainer provided quick, helpful, feedback.
