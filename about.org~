#+TITLE: Britt Anderson
   Currently, I live and work in Waterloo, Ontario Canada. While I very much enjoy Canada and its social values, one of the nicer things about Europe is that one can wear a beret, the world's most functional hat [fn:hat], without getting starred at.

[fn:hat] It is the most functional because it will keep you warm and protected from the sun. You can crush it in your pocket and it looks no worse for wear, and it is impossible to put on backwards.
