A few short notes on how I am trying to keep things up to date.

One problem with how I have done things is that the files I want to deploy are in a sub directory, but I would like to track all files for version control. I am trying a variant of something from org-page.

I create a branch that I called orgpublish that has all the files. Having done this, and having deleted all branches - including the master branch - I then created the master with 

~git subtree split --squash --prefix _site -b master~

Then I had to use force to get the origin (that is the github repo) synced up again. 

~git push --force origin master~

At this point I should be able to checkout orgpublish, commit all changes, then ~git subtree push --squash --prefix _site /home/britt/gitRepos/brittAnderson-github/ master~

And then a simple ~git push --all origin~ should update things for both branches.

The reason for the directory name is you have to provide the repo name and your local repo has the name of its parent directory (unless you set up some sort of an alias).
